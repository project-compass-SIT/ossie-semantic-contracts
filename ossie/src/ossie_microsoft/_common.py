"""Shared helpers for the Apache Ossie <-> Microsoft Power BI converters.

Cross-cutting concerns live here: version constants, the data type mapping in both
directions, the `custom_extensions` stash protocol, and the warning helper used to
report every lossy step.

Design rule for this converter pair: **never emit a plausible-looking expression that
was not authored for the target engine**. Power BI measures are DAX; Apache Ossie field
expressions are usually SQL. The two are not interchangeable, and a partial SQL-to-DAX
rewrite that silently produces invalid or subtly wrong DAX is worse than a refusal.
Where an expression cannot be carried across faithfully, the converter warns and uses
an explicit placeholder rather than guessing, preserving the source expression as
metadata when the target format supports it.

# Every lossy step is reported twice, on purpose, because the two channels answer
# different questions. A `UserWarning` is the programmatic contract: a caller can raise
# `warnings.simplefilter("error")` and get a hard guarantee the conversion was lossless.
# A log record is the operational channel: it carries the same message to whatever
# handler an embedding application configured, without that application having to
# install a warning filter.

# these constructs are simply absent. Reporting them is the difference between "Apache

# These catalogues list constructs with *semantic* meaning -- security, navigation,
# calculation, localization. Purely presentational TMSL properties (`isHidden`,

# The TMSL `dataType` vocabulary is the TOM DataType enum. Note that it has no
# date-only, time-only or timezone-aware member: Power BI stores every temporal value
# as `dateTime` and distinguishes date-only presentation purely via `formatString`.
# The Apache Ossie temporal types therefore do not survive a round trip on the
# `dataType` alone, which is why DATE_ONLY_FORMAT_RE exists below.
#
# Precision caveats that converters and consumers should be aware of:
#   * `int64`   -- a 64-bit integer in the model, but Power BI report visuals can only
#                  safely express values up to 2**53 - 1 (9007199254740991).
#   * `decimal` -- "Fixed Decimal Number": 19 digits of significance, exactly 4 digits
#                  to the right of the decimal point. Maps to Ossie `Decimal` (exact).
#   * `double`  -- "Decimal Number": 64-bit floating point, ~15 digits of precision and
#                  approximate. Maps to Ossie `Float`, NOT `Decimal`.
#   * `dateTime` -- model range is years 1900-9999 and time is stored at 1/300 second
#                  (3.33 ms) granularity, so sub-millisecond source data loses fidelity.
