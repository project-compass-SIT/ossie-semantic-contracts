"""Guards on how this converter is packaged.

The converter is distributed, so its layout is part of its contract rather than
an implementation detail. Every sibling Python converter in this repository ships
a single ``src/<package>/`` directory, and a flat ``src/*.py`` layout silently
breaks three things at once: the wheel publishes top-level modules that squat on
generic names like ``cli`` in every environment that installs it, the console
script fails to resolve, and ``import ossie_microsoft`` stops working even though
the package builds without complaint.

None of that is visible from the unit tests, which import modules through
``pythonpath = ["src"]`` and therefore pass either way. These tests close that
gap so the layout cannot regress unnoticed.
